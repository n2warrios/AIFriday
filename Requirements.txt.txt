Building a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system for a hackathon requires a clear "Information Architecture." You aren't just storing text; you are building a knowledge retrieval system that distinguishes between "The Final Truth" and "The Conversation."

1. The Data Hierarchy (What you store)
You must handle two separate "Buckets" of data to allow for deep drill-downs:

Bucket A: The Structured "Gold" Data (The JSON)

Key Summary: The high-level "too long; didn't read" overview.

Decisions Made: Specific, finalized outcomes.

Action Items: Tasks with owners and deadlines.

Bucket B: The Unstructured "Raw" Data (The Transcript)

The full "Who-said-what" text. This is essential for the "Why" and "How" questions that the summary might miss.

2. The Retrieval Logic (The "Drill-Down")
Your RAG needs to be "Aware" of where to look based on the user's intent:

Case 1 (Surface Query): If the user asks "What was the meeting about?", the system should prioritize Bucket A (Summary).

Case 2 (Detail Query): If the user asks "What are Mike's tasks?", the system should filter specifically for Bucket A (Action Items).

Case 3 (Deep Query): If the user asks "Why did we decide on Monday instead of Friday?", the system must search Bucket B (Transcript) to find the actual dialogue.

3. Metadata Tagging (The Secret Sauce)
To make this work in ChromaDB, every piece of data you save must have a label (Metadata). This is how you prevent the AI from confusing a random suggestion in the transcript with a final decision.

Tags to use: source: mentor_json, source: raw_transcript, type: action_item, type: decision, type: summary.

4. The "Creative" Requirements (Hackathon Edge)
To go "beyond the needs," your RAG should provide:

Traceability (Citations): When the AI answers a drill-down, it should tell the user exactly which line of the transcript it used as evidence.

Confidence Scoring: If a question is asked that isn't in the summary OR the transcript, the AI should say "Information not found" rather than guessing.


Input:

{
  "meeting_id": "MGT-101",
  "transcript": "Sarah: We should aim for a March launch. Mike: I need until April 15th for the database.",
  "key_summary": "The team discussed shifting the Q2 launch timeline.",
  "decisions_made": [
    "The launch date is officially moved to April 15th."
  ],
  "action_items": [
    {
      "task": "Update the roadmap",
      "owner": "Sarah",
      "due": "Feb 20th"
    },
    {
      "task": "Complete database migration",
      "owner": "Mike",
      "due": "April 1st"
    }
  ]
}


Output:

# How the UI Dev calls your code:
from rag_module import process_drilldown

# result will contain the Output Format above
result = process_drilldown(user_query, input_data)

st.write(result["answer"])
with st.expander("View Evidence"):
    st.write(result["evidence"])
