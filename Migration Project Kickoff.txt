A Teradata to Hadoop migration kickoff meeting requires meticulous alignment across diverse engineering teams to ensure a seamless transition from legacy hardware to a distributed ecosystem. This session begins with a comprehensive welcome and team introductions, where the Project Manager establishes the primary business drivers for the move, specifically focusing on reducing Teradata’s high licensing costs and increasing storage flexibility for unstructured data. The Product Owner defines the project vision, emphasizing that the move to Hadoop will enable advanced analytics and faster data processing speeds.
The core technical discussion centers on the migration scope, identifying specific subject areas like financial reporting or customer behavior logs that will be moved in the first wave. Technical leads detail the transition from BTEQ scripts to Spark or HiveQL, while outlining the data validation strategy using automated checksums to ensure 100% parity between systems. A significant portion of the meeting is dedicated to the infrastructure roadmap, including the setup of HDFS directories, YARN resource management, and security protocols like Kerberos and Apache Ranger.
The Project Manager introduces the RACI matrix to clarify who manages the legacy Teradata exports versus who builds the new Hadoop ingestion pipelines. Risks such as network latency during bulk loads and potential query performance degradation in the new environment are openly discussed, with mitigation strategies like using Apache Sqoop or optimized Parquet file formats proposed as solutions. Communication protocols are finalized, establishing Slack as the primary tool for developer coordination and Jira for tracking sprint progress. The meeting concludes with a summary of immediate action items, specifically the finalization of the source-to-target mapping document and the scheduling of follow-up deep dives into the ETL architecture, followed by a brief Q&A session to address any remaining stakeholder concerns.
Should I provide the detailed technical mapping of Teradata data types to Hadoop equivalents or create a project timeline for the first three months?
